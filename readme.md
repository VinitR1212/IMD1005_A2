# My Experience with This Assignment  

Working on this project was not bad. I started by structuring the different pages, adding content, and making sure everything looked good. The goal was to create a visually appealing and functional website that captures the beauty of the Caribbean.

One of the biggest challenges I faced was making sure the layout stayed clean and organized, especially when adding images and aligning elements properly. At times, images weren’t displaying the way I expected, and I had to adjust the CSS multiple times to fix alignment and spacing issues. Another challenge was ensuring the website was accessible, such as adding a skip link for easy navigation.

The main gimmick i added was the embedded maps to the website to allow the user to see the entire caribbean without going to google maps separately.

Overall, this project was a great way to practice real-world web development skills, and I feel like I’ve made solid progress. If there’s any specific feedback you have, especially about layout improvements or best practices, I’d really appreciate it! I also hope to integrate javascript as I was not comfortable yet to implement it.
